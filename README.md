### models
In the models folder we have the Pokemon interface and other interfaces related to this.

### services

## Improvements
- In the details page was needed to create a reusable component for Table, but for time reasons was not possible.
- Also for Moves in details page are a lot of data in some cases, and using pagination will be good.
- In the Pokemons list we need to show a message when no data, and to hide paginations.
- To add a spinner on Pokemons data load.
- To add a NotFound page if the user type a wrong url.
- Also Is good to write some unit tests for each component.
- To show any message if any error happens during data fetch.
- Also to put the pagination in a separate component
